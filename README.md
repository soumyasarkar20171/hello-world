# hello-world
my first git hub project
I am a long time developer but just now getting started on git hub. I think I will love it now I see how good it is.  
I am currently in a senior DBA role for about 7.5 years.  In the past I have been a java programming and SOA integration architect role for the 7 years prior, and a senior developer and project leader role for the 7 years prior.  


November 2019 -- now that I left this idle for a while, I wanted to touch this and make sure this repository was still working for me, and just to refresh my memory about using the github.  Venturing into more python etc now ...  

January 2025 -- getting back to this again -- as my work life had been pretty busy at other places and I am going to have some time available to do independent projects and help others at this time ..
