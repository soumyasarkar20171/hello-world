# hello-world
my first git hub project
I am a long time developer but just now getting started on git hub. I think I will love it now I see how good it is.  
I am currently in a senior DBA role for about 7.5 years.  In the past I have been a java programming and SOA integration architect role for the 7 years prior, and a senior developer and project leader role for the 7 years prior.
